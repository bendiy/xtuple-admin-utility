# Customer configuration for the Vagrantfile (based on vagrant.yaml.template)

# "Output" directories: would be available in /vagrant/var.
# Recommended to add symlinks to the same directories as it would be
# for a server setup, for example:
# - /vagrant/var/log â†’ /var/log/xtuple - to organize all the logs created by
#                                        xTuple processes.
#
# To track a new empty directory with a .gitkeep file,
# remove the /xtuple line, create a directory and a .gitkeep file,
# stash it, and return the /xtuple line back.
